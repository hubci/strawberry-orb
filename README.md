# Strawberry SSG Orb [![CI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/hubci/strawberry-orb.svg?style=shield "CI Build Status")](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hubci/strawberry-orb) [![CircleCI Orb Version](https://badges.circleci.com/orbs/hubci/strawberry.svg)][orb-page] [![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://github.com/hubci/strawberry-orb/blob/trunk/LICENSE)

This orb allows you to easily install and use the Strawberry Static Site Generator (SSG), formally known as Gotham, on CircleCI.
Strawberry is a static site generator used to build fast, efficient, and secure websites from Markdown files.
Strawberry is a soft fork of Hugo and is 99% compatible so this orb will work to build, test, and deploy both Gotham and Hugo websites.

Built-in testing is done with HTML Proofer.
This orb includes an executor you can use but works with Linux and macOS images.
